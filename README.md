**Sequential learning and language modeling with TensorFlow**

## What is this book about?
Developers struggle to find an easy-to-follow learning resource for implementing Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models. RNNs are the state-of-the-art model in deep learning for dealing with sequential data. From language translation to generating captions for an image, RNNs are used to continuously improve results. This book will teach you the fundamentals of RNNs, with example applications in Python and the TensorFlow library. The examples are accompanied by the right combination of theoretical knowledge and real-world implementations of concepts to build a solid foundation of neural network modeling.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Use TensorFlow to build RNN models
* Use the correct RNN architecture for a particular machine learning task
* Collect and clear the training data for your models
* Use the correct Python libraries for any task during the building phase of your model
* Optimize your model for higher accuracy

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
def generate_data():
    inputs = input_values()
    return inputs, output_values(inputs)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for Machine Learning engineers and data scientists who want to learn about Recurrent Neural Network models with practical use-cases. Exposure to Python programming is required. Previous experience with TensorFlow will be helpful, but not mandatory.

## Get to Know the Author
**Simeon Kostadinov**
is a student at the University of Birmingham, who also lives in San Francisco and works for a startup called Speechify which aims to help people go through their readings faster by converting any text into speech. Simeon is Machine Learning enthusiast who writes a blog and works on various projects on the side. His technical experience includes heavy university knowledge, two summer internships and two years of practical experience. Moreover, his blog includes explanations of numerous deep learning techniques. He enjoys reading different research papers and implement some of them in code. His interest covers both the theoretical as well as practical side of deep learning since his background is in mathematics and throughout time he ignited his interest in computer science. He was ranked number 1 in mathematics during his senior year of high school and thus he has deep passion about understanding how the deep learning models work under the hood. His specific knowledge in Recurrent Neural Networks comes from several courses that he has taken at Stanford University and University of Birmingham. They helped in understanding how to apply his theoretical knowledge into practice and build powerful models. In addition, he recently became a Stanford Scholar Initiative which includes working in a team of Machine Learning researchers on a specific deep learning research paper.
